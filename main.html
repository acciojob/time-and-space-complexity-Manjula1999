	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a concept in computer science that describes the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the size of the input to the algorithm. It is a measure of the efficient of an algorithm in terms of its running time. Time complexity is often expressed using big O notation, which provides an upper bound on the growth rate of an algorithm's running time.</p>
	<p> <b>Space complexity</b> is another critical concept in computer science, and it refers to the amount of memory space an algorithm uses as a function of the input size. Like time complexity, space complexity is often expressed using big O notation. If an algorithm has a space complexity of O(n), it means that the amount of memory space it requires grows linearly with the size of the input</p>
