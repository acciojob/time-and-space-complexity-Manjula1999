   <h1> Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
	<p> Time complexity is a crucial concept in computer science that measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete its task. It is a fundamental metric for evaluating the efficiency of algorithms. Efficient algorithms are characterized by low time complexity, ensuring that they perform well even as the size of the input grows. Choosing algorithms with optimal time complexity is essential for building fast and scalable software
	</p>
   <p> Space complexity, on the other hand, focuses on the amount of memory space an algorithm uses relative to the size of the input. When we talk about space complexity O(n), it means that the space required grows linearly with the size of the input. In other words, as the input size increases, the algorithm's memory usage increases proportionally. An example of linear space complexity is creating an array of size n to store input elements. <b>Space Complexity</b> is a critical consideration in designing algorithms, and optimizing it is crucial for efficient memory usage.
